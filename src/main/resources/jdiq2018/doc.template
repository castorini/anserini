# Anserini: JDIQ 2018 Experiments

This page documents the script used in the following article to compute optimal retrieval effectiveness by grid search over model parameters:

+ Peilin Yang, Hui Fang, and Jimmy Lin. [Anserini: Reproducible Ranking Baselines Using Lucene.](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3289400.3239571) Journal of Data and Information Quality, 10(4), Article 16, 2018.

**Important note**: We clearly state in the article:

> For all systems, we report results from parameter tuning to optimize average precision (AP) at rank 1000 on the newswire collections, WT10g, and Gov2, and NDCG@20 for the ClueWeb collections.
> There was no separation of training and test data, so these results should be interpreted as oracle settings.

If you're going to refer to these effectiveness results, _please_ be aware of what you're comparing!

**Additional note**: The values produced by these scripts are _slightly_ different than those reported in the article.
The reason for these differences stems from the fact that Anserini evolved throughout the peer review process; the values reported in the article were those generated when the manuscript was submitted.
By the time the article was published, the implementation of Anserini has progressed.
As Anserini continues to improve we will update these scripts, which will lead to further divergences between the published values.
Unfortunately, this is an unavoidable aspect of empirical research on software artifacts.

**Update (12/18/2018)**:
Regression effectiveness values further changed at commit `e71df7aee42c7776a63b9845600a4075632fa11c` Tue Dec 18 07:45:30 2018 -0500 with upgrade to Lucene 7.6.

## Parameter Tuning

Invoke the tuning script on various collections as follows, on `tuna`:

```
nohup python src/main/python/jdiq2018/run_regression.py --collection disk12 >& jdiq2018.disk12.log &
nohup python src/main/python/jdiq2018/run_regression.py --collection robust04 >& jdiq2018.robust04.log &
nohup python src/main/python/jdiq2018/run_regression.py --collection robust05 >& jdiq2018.robust05.log &
nohup python src/main/python/jdiq2018/run_regression.py --collection wt10g >& jdiq2018.wt10g.log &
nohup python src/main/python/jdiq2018/run_regression.py --collection gov2 >& jdiq2018.gov2.log &
nohup python src/main/python/jdiq2018/run_regression.py --collection cw09b --metrics map ndcg20 err20 >& jdiq2018.cw09b.log &
nohup python src/main/python/jdiq2018/run_regression.py --collection cw12b13 --metrics map ndcg20 err20 >& jdiq2018.cw12b13.log &
```

The script assumes hard-coded index directories; modify as appropriate.
