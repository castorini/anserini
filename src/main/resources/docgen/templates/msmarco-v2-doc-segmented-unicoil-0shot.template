# Anserini Regressions: MS MARCO (V2) Document Ranking

**Model**: uniCOIL (with doc2query-T5 expansions) zero-shot on segmented documents

This page describes regression experiments for document ranking _on the segmented version_ of the MS MARCO (V2) document corpus using the dev queries, which is integrated into Anserini's regression testing framework.
Here, we cover experiments with the uniCOIL model trained on the MS MARCO V1 passage ranking test collection, applied in a zero-shot manner, with doc2query-T5 expansion.

The uniCOIL model is described in the following paper:

> Jimmy Lin and Xueguang Ma. [A Few Brief Notes on DeepImpact, COIL, and a Conceptual Framework for Information Retrieval Techniques.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14807) _arXiv:2106.14807_.

The exact configurations for these regressions are stored in [this YAML file](${yaml}).
Note that this page is automatically generated from [this template](${template}) as part of Anserini's regression pipeline, so do not modify this page directly; modify the template instead.

From one of our Waterloo servers (e.g., `orca`), the following command will perform the complete regression, end to end:

```
python src/main/python/run_regression.py --index --verify --search --regression ${test_name}
```

## Corpus

Download, unpack, and prepare the corpus:

```
# Download
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/data/msmarco_v2_doc_segmented_unicoil_0shot.tar -P collections/

# Unpack
tar -xvf collections/msmarco_v2_doc_segmented_unicoil_0shot.tar -C collections/

# Rename (indexer is expecting corpus under a slightly different name)
mv collections/msmarco_v2_doc_segmented_unicoil_0shot collections/msmarco-v2-doc-segmented-unicoil-0shot
```

To confirm, `msmarco_v2_doc_segmented_unicoil_0shot.tar` is 62 GB and has an MD5 checksum of `889db095113cc4fe152382ccff73304a`.

## Indexing

Sample indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The path `/path/to/msmarco-v2-doc-segmented-unicoil-0shot/` should point to the corpus downloaded above.

The important indexing options to note here are `-impact -pretokenized`: the first tells Anserini not to encode BM25 doclengths into Lucene's norms (which is the default) and the second option says not to apply any additional tokenization on the uniCOIL tokens.
Upon completion, we should have an index with 124,131,414 documents.

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

Topics and qrels are stored in [`src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/).
These regression experiments use the [dev queries](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/topics.msmarco-v2-doc.dev.txt) and the [dev2 queries](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/topics.msmarco-v2-doc.dev2.txt).

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to reproduce the following results:

${effectiveness}
