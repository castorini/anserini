# Anserini: Regressions for [CAR17](http://trec-car.cs.unh.edu/) (v2.0)

This page documents regression experiments for the [TREC 2017 Complex Answer Retrieval (CAR)](http://trec-car.cs.unh.edu/) section-level passage retrieval task (v2.0).
The exact configurations for these regressions are stored in [this YAML file](../src/main/resources/regression/car17v2.0.yaml).
Note that this page is automatically generated from [this template](../src/main/resources/docgen/templates/car17v2.0.template) as part of Anserini's regression pipeline, so do not modify this page directly; modify the template instead.

## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The directory `/path/to/car17v2.0` should be the root directory of Complex Answer Retrieval (CAR) paragraph corpus (v2.0), which can be downloaded [here](http://trec-car.cs.unh.edu/datareleases/).

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

The "benchmarkY1-test" topics and qrels (v2.0) are stored in [`src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/), downloaded from [the CAR website](http://trec-car.cs.unh.edu/datareleases/):

+ [`topics.car17v2.0.benchmarkY1test.txt`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/topics.car17v2.0.benchmarkY1test.txt)
+ [`qrels.car17v2.0.benchmarkY1test.txt`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/qrels.car17v2.0.benchmarkY1test.txt)

Specifically, this is the section-level passage retrieval task with automatic ground truth.

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to replicate the following results:
