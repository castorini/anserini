# Anserini: Regressions for [FIRE 2012 Monolingual English](http://isical.ac.in/~fire/2012/adhoc.html)

This page documents regression experiments for [FIRE 2012 Ad-hoc retrieval (Monolingual English topic)](http://isical.ac.in/~fire/2012/adhoc.html).
The document collection can be found in [FIRE 2012 data page](http://fire.irsi.res.in/fire/static/data).

The exact configurations for these regressions are stored in [this YAML file](../src/main/resources/regression/fire-en.yaml).
Note that this page is automatically generated from [this template](../src/main/resources/docgen/templates/fire12-en.template) as part of Anserini's regression pipeline, so do not modify this page directly; modify the template instead.

## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The directory `/path/to/fire12-en/` should be a directory containing the collection, containing `en_BDNews24` and `en_TheTelegraph_2001-2010` directories.

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

Topics and qrels are stored in [`src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/).
The regression experiments here evaluate on the 50 questions.

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to replicate the following results:

${effectiveness}
