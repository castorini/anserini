# Anserini: Experiments on the [Washington Post](https://trec.nist.gov/data/wapost/) ([Core18](https://trec-core.github.io/2018/))

## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The directory `/path/to/core18/` should be the root directory of TREC Core2018 collection, i.e., `ls /path/to/core18/`
should bring up a single JSON file.

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

** Users of Anserini will need to download the topics and qrels directly from TREC's from NIST and put them
at `src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/` with file names `topics.core18.txt` and `qrels.core18.txt`.
** We will include the topics and qrels files after NIST publishes them.

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to replicate the following results:

${effectiveness}
