# Anserini: Regressions for the [Washington Post](https://trec.nist.gov/data/wapost/) ([Core18](https://trec-core.github.io/2018/))

This page describes regressions for the TREC 2018 Common Core Track, which uses the [TREC Washington Post Corpus](https://trec.nist.gov/data/wapost/).
The exact configurations for these regressions are stored in [this YAML file](../src/main/resources/regression/core18.yaml).
Note that this page is automatically generated from [this template](../src/main/resources/docgen/templates/core18.template) as part of Anserini's regression pipeline, so do not modify this page directly; modify the template instead.

## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The directory `/path/to/core18/` should be the root directory of the [TREC Washington Post Corpus](https://trec.nist.gov/data/wapost/), i.e., `ls /path/to/core18/`
should bring up a single JSON file.

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

Topics and qrels are stored in [`src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/), downloaded from NIST:

+ [`topics.core18.txt`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/topics.core18.txt): [topics for the TREC 2018 Common Core Track](https://trec.nist.gov/data/core/topics2018.txt)
+ [`qrels.core18.txt`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/qrels.core18.txt): [qrels for the TREC 2018 Common Core Track](https://trec.nist.gov/data/core/qrels2018.txt)

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to replicate the following results:
