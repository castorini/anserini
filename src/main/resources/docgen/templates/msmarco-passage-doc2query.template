# Anserini: Regressions for [MS MARCO Passage Retrieval](https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Passage-Ranking)

This page documents regression experiments for the MS MARCO Passage Retrieval Task with doc2query expansions (also called doc2query-base) , as proposed in the following paper:

> Rodrigo Nogueira, Wei Yang, Jimmy Lin, and Kyunghyun Cho. [Document Expansion by Query Prediction.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08375) arXiv:1904.08375, 2019.

These experiments are integrated into Anserini's regression testing framework.
For more complete instructions on how to run end-to-end experiments, refer to [this page](experiments-doc2query.md).

The exact configurations for these regressions are stored in [this YAML file](../src/main/resources/regression/msmarco-passage-doc2query.yaml).
Note that this page is automatically generated from [this template](../src/main/resources/docgen/templates/msmarco-passage-doc2query.template) as part of Anserini's regression pipeline, so do not modify this page directly; modify the template instead.

## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The directory `/path/to/msmarco-passage-doc2query` should be a directory containing `jsonl` files containing the expanded passage collection.
[This page](experiments-doc2query.md) explains how to perform this data preparation.

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

Topics and qrels are stored in [`src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/).
The regression experiments here evaluate on the 6980 dev set questions; see [this page](experiments-msmarco-passage.md) for more details.

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to reproduce the following results:

${effectiveness}

Explanation of settings:

+ The setting "default" refers the default BM25 settings of `k1=0.9`, `b=0.4`.
+ The setting "tuned" refers to `k1=0.82`, `b=0.68`, tuned on _on the original passages_, as described in [this page](experiments-msmarco-passage.md).

Note that the above runs are generated with `SearchCollection` in the TREC format, which due to tie-breaking effects gives slightly different results from `SearchMsmarco` in the MS MARCO format.

The following command generates with `SearchMsmarco` the run denoted "BM25 (tuned)" above (`k1=0.82`, `b=0.68`):

```bash
$ sh target/appassembler/bin/SearchMsmarco -hits 1000 -threads 8 \
    -index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-passage-doc2query.pos+docvectors+raw \
    -queries collections/msmarco-passage/queries.dev.small.tsv \
    -k1 0.82 -b 0.68 \
    -output runs/run.msmarco-passage-doc2query

$ python tools/scripts/msmarco/msmarco_passage_eval.py \
   collections/msmarco-passage/qrels.dev.small.tsv runs/run.msmarco-passage-doc2query

Note that this run does _not_ correspond to the scores reported in the paper that introduced doc2query:

> Rodrigo Nogueira, Wei Yang, Jimmy Lin, and Kyunghyun Cho. [Document Expansion by Query Prediction.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08375) arXiv:1904.08375, 2019.

The scores reported in the above paper refer to entry "BM25 (Anserini) + doc2query" dated 2019/04/10 on the [MS MARCO Passage Ranking Leaderboard](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/).
The paper/leaderboard run reports 0.215 MRR@10, which is slightly lower than the "BM25 (Tuned)" regression run above, due to an earlier version of Lucene (7.6) and use of default BM25 parameters.
