# Anserini Regressions: BRIGHT &mdash; Robotics

This page documents BM25 regression experiments for [BRIGHT &mdash; Robotics](https://brightbenchmark.github.io/).

The exact configurations for these regressions are stored in [this YAML file](${yaml}).
Note that this page is automatically generated from [this template](${template}) as part of Anserini's regression pipeline, so do not modify this page directly; modify the template instead and build Anserini to rebuild the documentation.

From one of our Waterloo servers (e.g., `orca`), the following command will perform the complete regression, end to end:

```
python src/main/python/run_regression.py --index --verify --search --regression ${test_name}
```

All the BRIGHT corpora are available for download:

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/castorini/collections-bright/resolve/main/bright-corpus.tar -P collections/
tar xvf collections/bright-corpus.tar -C collections/
```

The tarball is 284 MB and has MD5 checksum `568b594709a9977369033117bfb6889c`.
After download and unpacking the corpora, the `run_regression.py` command above should work without any issue.

## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The path `/path/to/${corpus}/` should point to the corpus downloaded above.
For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](${root_path}/docs/common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

Topics and qrels are stored [here](https://github.com/castorini/anserini-tools/tree/master/topics-and-qrels), which is linked to the Anserini repo as a submodule.

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to reproduce the following results:
