# Anserini: Regressions for MS MARCO Document Ranking

This page documents regression experiments for the [MS MARCO document ranking task](https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Document-Ranking), which is integrated into Anserini's regression testing framework.
Note that there are four different regression conditions for this task, and this page describes the following:

+ **Indexing Condition:** each MS MARCO document is first segmented into passages, each passage is treated as a unit of indexing
+ **Expansion Condition:** none

In the passage indexing condition, we select the score of the highest-scoring passage from a document as the score for that document to produce a document ranking; this is known as the MaxP technique.
All four conditions are described in detail [here](https://github.com/castorini/docTTTTTquery#reproducing-ms-marco-document-ranking-results-with-anserini), in the context of doc2query-T5.

The exact configurations for these regressions are stored in [this YAML file](../src/main/resources/regression/msmarco-doc-per-passage.yaml).
Note that this page is automatically generated from [this template](../src/main/resources/docgen/templates/msmarco-doc-per-passage.template) as part of Anserini's regression pipeline, so do not modify this page directly; modify the template instead.

## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The directory `/path/to/msmarco-doc-per-passage/` should be a directory containing the segmented paragraph collection; see [this link](https://github.com/castorini/docTTTTTquery#reproducing-ms-marco-document-ranking-results-with-anserini) for how to prepare this collection.

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

Topics and qrels are stored in [`src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/).
The regression experiments here evaluate on the 5193 dev set questions.

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to reproduce the following results:

Explanation of settings:

+ The setting "default" refers the default BM25 settings of `k1=0.9`, `b=0.4`.
+ The setting "tuned" refers to `k1=2.16`, `b=0.61`, tuned to optimize for recall@100 (i.e., for first-stage retrieval) on 2019/12.

In these runs, we are retrieving the top 1000 hits for each query and using `trec_eval` to evaluate all 1000 hits.
Since we're in the passage condition, we fetch the 10000 passages and select the top 1000 documents using MaxP.
This lets us measure R@100 and R@1000; the latter is particularly important when these runs are used as first-stage retrieval.
Beware, an official MS MARCO document ranking task leaderboard submission comprises only 100 hits per query.
See [this page](experiments-msmarco-doc-leaderboard.md) for details on Anserini baseline runs that were submitted to the official leaderboard.

The MaxP passage retrieval functionality is only available in `SearchCollection`; we use a simple script to convert the output back into the MS MARCO format for evaluation.

To generate an MS MARCO submission with the BM25 default parameters, corresponding to "BM25 (default)" above:

```bash
$ target/appassembler/bin/SearchCollection -topicreader TsvString \
   -topics src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/topics.msmarco-doc.dev.txt \
   -index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-doc-per-passage.pos+docvectors+raw \
   -output runs/run.msmarco-doc-per-passage.bm25-default.trec \
   -bm25 -bm25.k1 0.9 -bm25.b 0.4 -hits 1000 \
   -selectMaxPassage -selectMaxPassage.delimiter "#" -selectMaxPassage.hits 100

$ python tools/scripts/msmarco/convert_trec_to_msmarco_run.py \
   --input runs/run.msmarco-doc-per-passage.bm25-default.trec \
   --output runs/run.msmarco-doc-per-passage.bm25-default.txt

$ python tools/scripts/msmarco/msmarco_doc_eval.py \
   --judgments src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/qrels.msmarco-doc.dev.txt \
   --run runs/run.msmarco-doc-per-passage.bm25-default.txt

This run was _not_ submitted to the MS MARCO document ranking leaderboard, but is reported in the Lin et al. (SIGIR 2021) Pyserini paper.

To generate an MS MARCO submission with the BM25 tuned parameters, corresponding to "BM25 (tuned)" above:

```bash
$ target/appassembler/bin/SearchCollection -topicreader TsvString \
   -topics src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/topics.msmarco-doc.dev.txt \
   -index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-doc-per-passage.pos+docvectors+raw \

   -bm25 -bm25.k1 2.16 -bm25.b 0.61 -hits 1000 \
   -selectMaxPassage -selectMaxPassage.delimiter "#" -selectMaxPassage.hits 100

$ python tools/scripts/msmarco/convert_trec_to_msmarco_run.py \
   --input runs/run.msmarco-doc-per-passage.bm25-tuned.trec \

This run corresponds to the MS MARCO document ranking leaderboard entry "Anserini's BM25 (per passage), parameters tuned for recall@100 (k1=2.16, b=0.61)" dated 2021/01/20, and is reported in the Lin et al. (SIGIR 2021) Pyserini paper.
