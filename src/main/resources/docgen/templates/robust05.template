# Anserini: Regressions for [AQUAINT](https://tac.nist.gov//data/data_desc.html#AQUAINT) (Robust05)

## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The directory `/path/to/aquaint/` should be the root directory of AQUAINT collection; under subdirectory `disk1/` there should be `NYT/` and under subdirectory `disk2/` there should be `APW/` and `XIE/`.

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

Topics and qrels are stored in `src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/`, downloaded from NIST:

+ `topics.robust05.txt`: [Hard Topics of Robust04 (TREC 2005 Robust Track)](http://trec.nist.gov/data/robust/05/05.50.topics.txt)
+ `qrels.robust2005.txt`: [qrels (TREC 2005 Robust Track)](http://trec.nist.gov/data/robust/05/TREC2005.qrels.txt)

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to replicate the following results:

${effectiveness}
