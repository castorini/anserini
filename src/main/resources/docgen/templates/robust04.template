# Anserini: Regressions for [Disks 4 &amp; 5](https://trec.nist.gov/data_disks.html) (Robust04)

This page describes regressions for the TREC 2004 Robust Track, which uses [TREC Disks 4 &amp; 5](https://trec.nist.gov/data_disks.html).
The exact configurations for these regressions are stored in [this YAML file](../src/main/resources/regression/robust04.yaml).
Note that this page is automatically generated from [this template](../src/main/resources/docgen/templates/robust04.template) as part of Anserini's regression pipeline, so do not modify this page directly; modify the template instead.

## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The directory `/path/to/disk45/` should be the root directory of [TREC Disks 4 &amp; 5](https://trec.nist.gov/data_disks.html); inside each there should be subdirectories like `ft`, `fr94`.
Note that Anserini ignores the `cr` folder when indexing, which is the standard configuration.

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

Topics and qrels are stored in [`src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/), downloaded from NIST:

+ [`topics.robust04.txt`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/topics.robust04.txt): [topics for the TREC 2004 Robust Track (Topics 301-450 &amp; 601-700)](http://trec.nist.gov/data/robust/04.testset.gz)
+ [`qrels.robust04.txt`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/qrels.robust04.txt): [qrels for the TREC 2004 Robust Track (Topics 301-450 &amp; 601-700)](http://trec.nist.gov/data/robust/qrels.robust2004.txt)

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to replicate the following results:
