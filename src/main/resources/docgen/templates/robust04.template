# Anserini: Experiments on [Disks 4 &amp; 5](https://trec.nist.gov/data_disks.html) (Robust04)

## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The directory `/path/to/disk45/` should be the root directory of Disk4 and Disk5 collection; inside each there should be subdirectories like `ft`, `fr94`.
Note that Anserini ignores the `cr` folder when indexing, which is the standard configuration.

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

Topics and qrels are stored in `src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/`, downloaded from NIST:

+ `topics.robust04.301-450.601-700.txt`: [Topics 301-450 &amp; 601-700 (TREC 2004 Robust Track)](http://trec.nist.gov/data/robust/04.testset.gz)
+ `qrels.robust2004.txt`: [qrels for Topics 301-450 &amp; 601-700 (TREC 2004 Robust Track)](http://trec.nist.gov/data/robust/qrels.robust2004.txt)

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to replicate the following results:

${effectiveness}
