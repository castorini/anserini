# Anserini: Regressions for [CAR17](http://trec-car.cs.unh.edu/) (v1.5)

This page documents regression experiments for the [TREC 2017 Complex Answer Retrieval (CAR)](http://trec-car.cs.unh.edu/) section-level passage retrieval task (v1.5).

## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The directory `/path/to/car17v1.5` should be the root directory of Complex Answer Retrieval (CAR) paragraph corpus (v1.5), which can be downloaded [here](http://trec-car.cs.unh.edu/datareleases/).

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

The "benchmarkY1-test" topics and qrels (v1.5) are stored in `src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/`, downloaded from [the CAR website](http://trec-car.cs.unh.edu/datareleases/):

+ `topics.car17v1.5.benchmarkY1test.txt`
+ `qrels.car17v1.5.benchmarkY1test.txt`

Specifically, this is the section-level passage retrieval task with automatic ground truth.

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to replicate the following results:
