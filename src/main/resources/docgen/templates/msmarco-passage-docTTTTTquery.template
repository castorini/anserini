# Anserini: Regressions for [MS MARCO Passage Retrieval](https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Passage-Ranking)

This page documents regression experiments for the MS MARCO Passage Retrieval Task with [docTTTTTquery](https://github.com/castorini/docTTTTTquery) expansions.
These experiments are integrated into Anserini's regression testing framework.

The exact configurations for these regressions are stored in [this YAML file](../src/main/resources/regression/msmarco-passage-docTTTTTquery.yaml).
Note that this page is automatically generated from [this template](../src/main/resources/docgen/templates/msmarco-passage-docTTTTTquery.template) as part of Anserini's regression pipeline, so do not modify this page directly; modify the template instead.

## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The directory `/path/to/msmarco-passage/` should be a directory containing `jsonl` files converted from the official passage collection, appended with the docTTTTTquery expansions.

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

Topics and qrels are stored in [`src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/).
The regression experiments here evaluate on the 6980 dev set questions; see [this page](experiments-msmarco-passage.md) for more details.

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to replicate the following results:

${effectiveness}

The setting "default" refers the default BM25 settings of `k1=0.9`, `b=0.4`, while "tuned" refers to the tuned setting of `k1=0.82`, `b=0.72` _on the original passages_.
See [this page](experiments-msmarco-passage.md) for more details.

To replicate the _exact_ conditions for a leaderboard submission, retrieve using the following command:

```bash
wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/hq6xjhswiz60siu/queries.dev.small.tsv

sh target/appassembler/bin/SearchMsmarco -threads 8 \
 -index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-passage-docTTTTTquery.pos+docvectors+raw \
 -queries queries.dev.small.tsv \
 -output runs/run.msmarco-passage-docTTTTTquery -hits 1000
```

Evaluate using the MS MARCO eval script:

```bash
wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/khsplt2fhqwjs0v/qrels.dev.small.tsv

python tools/scripts/msmarco/msmarco_passage_eval.py qrels.dev.small.tsv runs/run.msmarco-passage-docTTTTTquery
```

The results should be:

```
#####################
MRR @10: 0.27680089370991834
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

Which matches the score described in [the docTTTTTquery repo](https://github.com/castorini/docTTTTTquery) and also on the official [MS MARCO leaderboard](http://www.msmarco.org/).
