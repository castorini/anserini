# Anserini: Regressions for [MS MARCO Passage Retrieval](https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Passage-Ranking)

This page documents regression experiments for the MS MARCO Passage Retrieval Task with [docTTTTTquery](https://github.com/castorini/docTTTTTquery) expansions.
These experiments are integrated into Anserini's regression testing framework.

The exact configurations for these regressions are stored in [this YAML file](../src/main/resources/regression/msmarco-passage-docTTTTTquery.yaml).
Note that this page is automatically generated from [this template](../src/main/resources/docgen/templates/msmarco-passage-docTTTTTquery.template) as part of Anserini's regression pipeline, so do not modify this page directly; modify the template instead.

## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The directory `/path/to/msmarco-passage/` should be a directory containing `jsonl` files converted from the official passage collection, appended with the docTTTTTquery expansions.

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

Topics and qrels are stored in [`src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/).
The regression experiments here evaluate on the 6980 dev set questions; see [this page](experiments-msmarco-passage.md) for more details.

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to reproduce the following results:

${effectiveness}

The setting "default" refers the default BM25 settings of `k1=0.9`, `b=0.4`, while "tuned" refers to the tuned setting of `k1=0.82`, `b=0.72` _on the original passages_.
See [this page](experiments-msmarco-passage.md) for more details.

Note that the above runs are generated with `SearchCollection` in the TREC format, which due to tie-breaking effects gives slightly different results from `SearchMsmarco` in the MS MARCO format.

The following command generates with `SearchMsmarco` the run denoted "BM25 (Tuned)" above (`k1=0.82`, `b=0.68`), which corresponds to the entry "docTTTTTquery" dated 2019/11/27 on the [MS MARCO Passage Ranking Leaderboard](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/):

```bash
$ sh target/appassembler/bin/SearchMsmarco -hits 1000 -threads 8 \
    -index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-passage-docTTTTTquery.pos+docvectors+raw \
    -queries collections/msmarco-passage/queries.dev.small.tsv \
    -k1 0.82 -b 0.68 \
    -output runs/run.msmarco-passage-docTTTTTquery

$ python tools/scripts/msmarco/msmarco_passage_eval.py \
   collections/msmarco-passage/qrels.dev.small.tsv runs/run.msmarco-passage-docTTTTTquery

This corresponds to the score reported in the following paper:

> Rodrigo Nogueira and Jimmy Lin. [From doc2query to docTTTTTquery.](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/publications/Nogueira_Lin_2019_docTTTTTquery-v2.pdf) December 2019.

And is identical to the score reported in [the docTTTTTquery repo](https://github.com/castorini/docTTTTTquery).
