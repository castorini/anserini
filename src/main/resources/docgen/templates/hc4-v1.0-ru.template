# Anserini Regressions: HC4 (v1.0) &mdash; Russian

This page documents BM25 regression experiments for [HC4 (v1.0) &mdash; Russian](https://github.com/hltcoe/HC4), [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.09992.pdf).

The exact configurations for these regressions are stored in [this YAML file](${yaml}).
Note that this page is automatically generated from [this template](${template}) as part of Anserini's regression pipeline, so do not modify this page directly; modify the template instead.

From one of our Waterloo servers (e.g., `orca`), the following command will perform the complete regression, end to end:

```
python src/main/python/run_regression.py --index --verify --search --regression ${test_name}
```

## Corpus Download

The HC4 corpus can be downloaded following the instructions [here](https://github.com/hltcoe/HC4).

After download, verify that all and only specified documents have been downloaded by running the code [provided here](https://github.com/hltcoe/HC4#postprocessing-of-the-downloaded-documents).

With the corpus downloaded, unpack into `collections/` and run the following command to perform the remaining steps below:

```bash
python src/main/python/run_regression.py --index --verify --search --regression ${test_name} \
  --corpus-path collections/${corpus}
```


## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

See [this page](https://github.com/hltcoe/HC4) for more details about the HC4 corpus.
For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to reproduce the following results:
