# Anserini: Regressions for DeepImpact on [MS MARCO Passage](https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Passage-Ranking)

This page documents regression experiments for DeepImpact on the MS MARCO Passage Ranking Task, which is integrated into Anserini's regression testing framework.
DeepImpact is described in the following paper:

> Antonio Mallia, Omar Khattab, Nicola Tonellotto, and Torsten Suel. [Learning Passage Impacts for Inverted Indexes.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404835.3463030) _SIGIR 2021_.

For more complete instructions on how to run end-to-end experiments, refer to [this page](experiments-msmarco-passage-deepimpact.md).

The exact configurations for these regressions are stored in [this YAML file](../src/main/resources/regression/msmarco-passage-deepimpact.yaml).
Note that this page is automatically generated from [this template](../src/main/resources/docgen/templates/msmarco-passage-deepimpact.template) as part of Anserini's regression pipeline, so do not modify this page directly; modify the template instead.

## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The directory `/path/to/msmarco-passage-deepimpact/` should be a directory containing the compressed `jsonl` files that comprise the corpus.
See [this page](experiments-msmarco-passage-deepimpact.md) for additional details.

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

Topics and qrels are stored in [`src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/).
The regression experiments here evaluate on the 6980 dev set questions; see [this page](experiments-msmarco-passage.md) for more details.

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to reproduce the following results:

${effectiveness}

The above runs are in TREC output format and evaluated with `trec_eval`.
In order to reproduce results reported in the paper, we need to convert to MS MARCO output format and then evaluate:

```bash
python tools/scripts/msmarco/convert_trec_to_msmarco_run.py \
   --input runs/run.msmarco-passage-deepimpact.deepimpact.topics.msmarco-passage.dev-subset.deep-impact.tsv.gz \
   --output runs/run.msmarco-passage-deepimpact.deepimpact.topics.msmarco-passage.dev-subset.deep-impact.tsv.gz.msmarco --quiet

python tools/scripts/msmarco/msmarco_passage_eval.py \
   collections/msmarco-passage/qrels.dev.small.tsv \
   runs/run.msmarco-passage-deepimpact.deepimpact.topics.msmarco-passage.dev-subset.deep-impact.tsv.gz.msmarco
```

The results should be as follows:

```
#####################
MRR @10: 0.3252764133351524
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

The final evaluation metric is very close to the one reported in the paper (0.326).
