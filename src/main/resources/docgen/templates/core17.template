# Anserini: Regressions for the [New York Times](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19) ([Core17](https://trec-core.github.io/2017/))

## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The directory `/path/to/nyt_corpus/` should be the root directory of TREC Core2017 collection, i.e., `ls /path/to/nyt_corpus/`
should bring up a bunch of subdirectories, `1987` to `2007`.

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

Topics and qrels are stored in `src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/`, downloaded from NIST:

+ `topics.core17.txt`: [Topics that were assessed by NIST assessors (TREC 2017 NYT)](https://trec.nist.gov/data/core/core_nist.txt)
+ `qrels.core17.txt`: [qrels judgments produced by NIST assessors (TREC 2017 NYT)](https://trec.nist.gov/data/core/qrels.txt)

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to replicate the following results:

${effectiveness}
