# Anserini Regressions: MS MARCO Passage Ranking

**Models**: BM25 with quantized weights (8 bits)

This page documents regression experiments on the [MS MARCO passage ranking task](https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Passage-Ranking), which is integrated into Anserini's regression testing framework.
For more complete instructions on how to run end-to-end experiments, refer to [this page](experiments-msmarco-passage.md).

The exact configurations for these regressions are stored in [this YAML file](${yaml}).
Note that this page is automatically generated from [this template](${template}) as part of Anserini's regression pipeline, so do not modify this page directly; modify the template instead.

From one of our Waterloo servers (e.g., `orca`), the following command will perform the complete regression, end to end:

```
python src/main/python/run_regression.py --index --verify --search --regression ${test_name}
```

## Indexing

Typical indexing command:

```
${index_cmds}
```

The directory `/path/to/msmarco-passage/` should be a directory containing `jsonl` files containing quantized BM25 vectors for every document

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

Topics and qrels are stored in [`src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/).
The regression experiments here evaluate on the 6980 dev set questions; see [this page](experiments-msmarco-passage.md) for more details.

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
${ranking_cmds}
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
${eval_cmds}
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to reproduce the following results:
