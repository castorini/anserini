In DNA, UVGI predominately produces damage in the form of cyclobutylpyrimidine dimers and (6-4) photoproducts. These photoproducts disrupt the replication of the genetic material and, therefore, inhibit the replication. There is limited information regarding the effect of UVGI on RNA. There are conflicting studies on viruses with RNA genomes that have attempted to determine if PCR assays are inhibited by UVGI. Two studies involving hepatitis A virus (single-stranded positive sense RNA genome) and rotavirus (double-stranded RNA genome), showed their PCR assays to be inhibited by UV inactivation of the viruses [28, 29] . Conversely, Ma et al showed no effect of UV on a PCR assay when they irradiated poliovirus (singlestranded positive sense RNA genome) [30] . In this study, we present an extremely sensitive PCR based assay to detect airborne rhinovirus and demonstrate the effect of ultraviolet irradiation on the assay.",

The UV exposure chamber is comprised of a fused quartz UV exposure window (279 \u00d7 254 mm), on which a UV fixture containing six 36-watt UV lamps (Lumalier, Memphis, Tennessee) sits. We inserted two types of screens beneath the UV fixture to adjust the level of irradiance. Downstream of the exposure chamber a slide contains three ports. One port is used to collect the aerosol sample with our sampling filters (Teflo 2.0 \u00b5m pore, Pall Gelman, Ann Arbor, Michigan) mounted in filter cassettes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, Massachusetts) while the other ports can be loaded with two Teflo filters in series, to allow a bypass while changing sampling filters.

Neither of the previous studies were conducted on aerosolized virus and the dose of UV was several orders of magnitude greater. This study, did not determine whether the rhinovirus aerosol was capable of infection after exposure to the high UV dose used in these experiments. It is possible that the UV irradiation damaged other regions of the viral RNA and not the region that our primers amplified, or that the amount of damage required to prevent RT-PCR amplification is greater than the amount of damage sufficient to prevent infection.

In a study published in 1966, investigators from the U.S. Army Biological Laboratories and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, conducted a series of tests designed to determine if respiratory viral agents were transmitted via the aerosol route. Using rhinovirus type 15, they inoculated volunteers in the nose with both nasal drops and an aerosol (particle size 0.3 to 2.5 \u00b5m). The authors estimated a human ID 50 of 0.032 TCID 50 for nasal drops and 0.68 TCID 50 for aerosols [36] . In a study conducted in 1984, researchers inoculated volunteers with rhinovirus type 16 with droplets of viral suspension in several locations. The authors determined the ID 50 for nasal drops was 0.28 TCID 50 [37] . If we assume that the infectious dose is acquired through an aerosol, the aerosol data from 1966 suggests that our assay can detect an amount approximately equal to twice the ID 50 in humans. But, if the spiking experiment is a better estimate of actual detection limit due to the inactivation by the nebulizer, then our detection limit is approximately equal to the ID 50 .",

The use of filter collection allows for a much longer sample time, while impingers cannot be used for longer than 15-20 minutes. As was demonstrated here, filters can be used to collect at least 40-hour samples without reduced ability to detect virus on the filter. Cell culture methods, while useful in determining the amount of infectious virus, could not be used to detect the very low levels of infectious virus present in room air because collection of viable virus over long sampling times is not currently feasible. Therefore, the use of filter collection and PCR based detection is the only method presently available to detect low concentrations of respiratory virus in air. However, at UV doses much higher than typically used in upper room UV applications, this method was unable to distinguish between UV irradiated aerosols and nonexposed aerosols. ",

The PCR mixture contained 2 \u00d7 reaction buffer (0.4 mM of each dNTP, 2.4 mM MgSO 4 ), 1 \u00b5l of each primer (0.2 \u00b5M), 1 \u00b5l RT/PLATINUM Taq Mix and 10 \u00b5l of the RNA template in a final volume of 50 \u00b5l. We conducted the PCR reaction in a MJ Research (Watertown, Massachusetts) PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler programmed with an initial cDNA synthesis and pre-denaturation step of 50\u00b0C for 30 minutes and 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes followed by then 36 cycles of denature, annealing and extension (15 s at 94\u00b0C, 30 s at 55\u00b0C, 30 s at 68\u00b0C). We then amplified the PCR products from the RT-PCR step using primers OL26 (5'-GCA CTT CTG TTT CCC C-3') and JWA-1b (5'-CAT TCA GGG GCC GGA GGA-3') [34]. The PCR mixture contained 2 \u00d7 reaction buffer (0.4 mM of each dNTP, 2.4 mM MgSO 4 ), 1 \u00b5l of each primer (0.2 \u00b5M), 0.25 \u00b5l AmpliTaq (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) and 10 \u00b5l of RT-PCR product in a final volume",
