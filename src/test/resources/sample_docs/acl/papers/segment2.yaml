  abstract_html: Neural networks with attention have proven effective for many natural
    language processing tasks. In this paper, we develop attention mechanisms for
    uncertainty detection. In particular, we generalize standardly used attention
    mechanisms by introducing external attention and sequence-preserving attention.
    These novel architectures differ from standard approaches in that they use external
    resources to compute attention weights and preserve sequence information. We compare
    them to other configurations along different dimensions of attention. Our novel
    architectures set the new state of the art on a Wikipedia benchmark dataset and
    perform similar to the state-of-the-art model on a biomedical benchmark which
    uses a large set of linguistic features.
