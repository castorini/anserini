<title> Most Dangerous Vehicles 

<desc> Description: 
Which are the most crashworthy, and least crashworthy, 
passenger vehicles?
 
<narr> Narrative: 
A relevant document will contain information on the 
crashworthiness of a given vehicle or vehicles that 
can be used to draw a comparison with other vehicles.  
The document will have to describe/compare vehicles, 
not drivers.  For instance, it should be expected 
that vehicles preferred by 16-25 year-olds would be 
involved in more crashes, because that age group is
involved in more crashes.  I would view number of 
fatalities per 100 crashes to be more revealing of 
a vehicle's crashworthiness than the number of
crashes per 100,000 miles, for example.

way and the location of the project.  Renovation of existing
facilities would be judged not relevant unless plans call for a
significant increase in acre-feet or reservoir or a marked change
in the environmental impact of the project.  Arguments for and
against proposed projects are relevant as long as they are supported 
by specifics, including as a minimum the name or location of the
project.  A statement that an individual or organization is for or
against such projects in general would not be relevant.  Proposals
or projects underway to dismantle existing facilities or drain
existing reservoirs are not relevant, nor are articles reporting a

A tooth replacement procedure, begun in the 1960s by Doctor
Branemark, is becoming more widely used today.  It involves 
the replacement of a lost tooth/teeth by an implantation 
process which secures the fabricated tooth to a titanium post
with an adhesive resulting in a stable and sturdy denture 
almost like the original.  A relevant document will include 
any clinical experiment, report, study, paper, or medical 
discussion which describes the advantages or disadvantages of 
tooth implant(s), conditions under which such a procedure is 
favorable, denture comfort and function compared to false teeth, 
bridge, or plate and comparative cost differential.

<title> Rap and Crime 

<desc> Description: 
Evidence that rap music has a negative effect on young people.

<narr> Narrative: 
The lyrics to Rap music are replete with words which degrade
women, glorify drug abuse, the killing of policemen and even
romanticize suicide.  A crusade was begun a few years ago in
which the music industry was asked "to clean up its act" 
because of the detrimental effect it was having upon teenagers.  
There were some instances in which teenagers, who demonstrated 
no sign of internal strife, committed suicide.  The only clues
to their self-destruction were notes found near the bodies with
lyrics from Rap songs relating to suicide.  A relevant item 
should include any psychological study, evidence, poll, 
documentation, or psychological opinion that Rap music has a 
deleterious effect upon young people and has led to a discernible
change in personality, life style, crime, alteration of personality
or any other negative effect upon the psyche, mores, and culture
of teenagers.

<narr> Narrative: 
A relevant document will contain specific information on the
theft of trade secrets on new or existing technology.  Relevant
information includes, but is not limited to, espionage in the
highly competitive fashion industry, toy companies, drug firms,
and computer companies.  An apparently legal way of stealing
company secrets is by using the Freedom of Information Act, 
passed by the U.S. Congress in 1966 to help people and the 
press get information for the public good.  The law has often
been used instead by companies for private gain.  Documents
discussing company counterespionage are also considered to be
relevant.

<title> Polygamy Polyandry Polygyny  

<desc> Description: 
A look at the roots and prevalence of polygamy 
in the world today.

<narr> Narrative: 
Polygamy is a form of marriage which permits a
person to have more than one husband or wife.
Polyandry refers to one woman sharing two or 
more husbands at the same time.  Polygyny refers
to one man sharing two or more wives at the 
same time.  Primary focus of the search will be
the prevalence of these practices in the world
today and societal attitudes towards these
practices.  Also relevant would be discussions
of the roots and practical sources of these
customs.  A modern development in this area is
serial polygamy, a phrase coined to label the
practice of men who take a series of wives in
sequence as a solution to practical welfare,
considerations of child care, housing, etc.
Documents discussing serial polygamy will not
be considered relevant.

considered such software to be subject to the same
export controls as munitions, and has sought to 
restrict the export of encryption software unless 
it contains a device which could allow the U.S. to
read the underlying messages.  Business interests 
say that this will make it impossible for U.S. producers
to compete in the international market.

<narr> Narrative: 
A relevant document would contain reports on what
new steps airports worldwide have taken to better 
scrutinize passengers and their luggage on 
international flights and to step up screening of
all carry-on baggage.  With the increase in 
international terrorism and in the wake of the
TWA Flight 800 disaster, articles on airport 
security relating in particular to additional
steps taken by airports to increase flight safety
would be relevant.  The mere mention of enhanced 
security does not constitute relevance.  Additional
steps refer to something beyond just passenger
and carry-on screening using the normal methods.
Examples of new steps would be additional personnel, 
sophisticated monitoring and screening devices, 
and extraordinary measures to check luggage in the 
baggage compartment.
