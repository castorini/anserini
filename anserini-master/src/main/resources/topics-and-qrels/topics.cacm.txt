 I'm interested in mechanisms for communicating between disjoint processes,
possibly, but not exclusively, in a distributed environment.  I would
rather see descriptions of complete mechanisms, with or without implementations,
as opposed to theoretical work on the abstract problem.  Remote procedure
calls and message-passing are examples of my interests.
