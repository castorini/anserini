# Elastirini: Anserini Integration with Elasticsearch

Anserini provides code for indexing into an ELK stack, thus providing interoperable support existing test collections.

## Deploying ELK stack locally

We use [docker-elk](https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk) to set up the ELK stack locally.

Before we start, make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed and running.

First, we clone the repository and switch into the directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk.git && cd docker-elk
```

Depending on the documents you are indexing, you probably also have to increase the ELK stack's heap size in `docker-compose.yml`:

To increase Elasticsearch's heap size:

```
sed -i 's/ES_JAVA_OPTS: "-Xmx256m -Xms256m"/ES_JAVA_OPTS: "-Xmx1g -Xms512m"/' docker-compose.yml
```

If you are on MacOS:

```
sed -i '' 's/ES_JAVA_OPTS: "-Xmx256m -Xms256m"/ES_JAVA_OPTS: "-Xmx1g -Xms512m"/' docker-compose.yml
```

To increase Logstash's heap size:

```
sed -i 's/LS_JAVA_OPTS: "-Xmx256m -Xms256m"/LS_JAVA_OPTS: "-Xmx1g -Xms512m"/' docker-compose.yml
```

If you are on MacOS:

```
sed -i '' 's/LS_JAVA_OPTS: "-Xmx256m -Xms256m"/LS_JAVA_OPTS: "-Xmx1g -Xms512m"/' docker-compose.yml
```

Note `-Xmx` is the maximum memory that can be allocated, and `-Xms` is the initial memory allocated. You can specify these values as needed.

You can further specify general configurations for any of the ELK components by changing the file `[name]/config/[name].yml`. For instance, to further specify the configuration of Elasticsearch, you can make changes to `elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml`.

Then, we can build and start the Docker containers for the ELK stack to run.

`docker-compose up`

If at some point one of the ELK components is failing for some reason, or if you have changed its configurations while the containers are running, try restarting it. For instance, to restart Kibana:

`docker-compose restart kibana`

## Indexing

Once we have a local instance of Elasticsearch up and running, we can index using Elasticsearch through Elastirini.

First, let us create the index in Elasticsearch.

```
curl --user elastic:changeme -XPUT "localhost:9200/yourindexname"
```

Here, the username and password are those defaulted by `docker-elk`. You can change these if you like.

You can further specify the settings associated with this index. For example, if you would like to change `index.refresh_interval` from the default 1 second to 60 seconds:

```
curl --user elastic:changeme -XPUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'localhost:9200/yourindexname/_settings' -d '{ "index": { "refresh_interval": "60s"}}'
```

Now, we can start indexing through Elastirini. Here, instead of passing in `-index` (to index with Lucene directly) or `-solr` (to index with Solr), we pass in `-es`. For example, to index [robust04](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-robust04.md), we could run:

```
sh target/appassembler/bin/IndexCollection -collection TrecCollection -generator JsoupGenerator -es -es.index yourindexname -threads 16 -input /absolute/path/to/disk45 -storePositions -storeDocvectors -storeRawDocs
```

There are also other `-es` parameters that you can specify as you see fit.
