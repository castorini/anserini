# Anserini: Regressions for uniCOIL on [MS MARCO Document](https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Document-Ranking)

This page documents regression experiments for uniCOIL on the MS MARCO Document Ranking Task, which is integrated into Anserini's regression testing framework.
The uniCOIL model is described in the following paper:

> Jimmy Lin and Xueguang Ma. [A Few Brief Notes on DeepImpact, COIL, and a Conceptual Framework for Information Retrieval Techniques.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14807) _arXiv:2106.14807_.

The experiments on this page are not actually reported in the paper.
However, the model is the same, applied to the MS MARCO _segmented_ document corpus (with doc2query-T5 expansions).
Retrieval uses MaxP technique, where we select the score of the highest-scoring passage from a document as the score for that document to produce a document ranking.

For more complete instructions on how to run end-to-end experiments, refer to [this page](experiments-msmarco-unicoil.md).

The exact configurations for these regressions are stored in [this YAML file](../src/main/resources/regression/msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil.yaml).
Note that this page is automatically generated from [this template](../src/main/resources/docgen/templates/msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil.template) as part of Anserini's regression pipeline, so do not modify this page directly; modify the template instead and then run `bin/build.sh` to rebuild the documentation.

## Corpus

We make available a version of the MS MARCO passage corpus that has already been processed with uniCOIL, i.e., gone through document expansion and term reweighting.
Thus, no neural inference is involved.
For details on how to train uniCOIL and perform inference, please see [this guide](https://github.com/luyug/COIL/tree/main/uniCOIL).

Download the corpus and unpack into `collections/`:

```
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/JIMMYLIN-bucket0/data/msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil.tar -P collections/

tar xvf collections/msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil.tar -C collections/
```

To confirm, `msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil.tar` is 18 GB and has MD5 checksum `6a00e2c0c375cb1e52c83ae5ac377ebb`.

## Indexing

Sample indexing command:

```
target/appassembler/bin/IndexCollection \
  -collection JsonVectorCollection \
  -input /path/to/msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil \
  -index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil/ \
  -generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
  -threads 16 -impact -pretokenized \
  >& logs/log.msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil &
```

The directory `/path/to/msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil/` should point to the corpus downloaded above.

The important indexing options to note here are `-impact -pretokenized`: the first tells Anserini not to encode BM25 doclengths into Lucene's norms (which is the default) and the second option says not to apply any additional tokenization on the uniCOIL tokens.
Upon completion, we should have an index with 20,545,677 documents.

For additional details, see explanation of [common indexing options](common-indexing-options.md).

## Retrieval

Topics and qrels are stored in [`src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/`](../src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/).
The regression experiments here evaluate on the 6980 dev set questions; see [this page](experiments-msmarco-passage.md) for more details.

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```
target/appassembler/bin/SearchCollection \
  -index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil/ \
  -topics src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/topics.msmarco-doc.dev.unicoil.tsv.gz \
  -topicreader TsvInt \
  -output runs/run.msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil.unicoil.topics.msmarco-doc.dev.unicoil.txt \
  -impact -pretokenized -hits 10000 -selectMaxPassage -selectMaxPassage.delimiter "#" -selectMaxPassage.hits 1000 &
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```
tools/eval/trec_eval.9.0.4/trec_eval -c -m map -c -m recall.100 -c -m recall.1000 src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/qrels.msmarco-doc.dev.txt runs/run.msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil.unicoil.topics.msmarco-doc.dev.unicoil.txt
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to reproduce the following results:

| MAP                                                                                                          | uniCOIL w/ doc2query-T5 expansion|

|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|

This model corresponds to the run named "uniCOIL-d2q" on the official MS MARCO Document Ranking Leaderboard, submitted 2021/09/16.
The following command generates a comparable run:

```
target/appassembler/bin/SearchCollection \
  -index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil/ \
  -topics src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/topics.msmarco-doc.dev.unicoil.tsv.gz \
  -topicreader TsvInt \
  -output runs/run.msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil.msmarco-doc.dev.txt \
  -format msmarco \
  -impact -pretokenized -hits 10000 -selectMaxPassage -selectMaxPassage.delimiter "#" -selectMaxPassage.hits 100
```

Note that the above command uses `-format msmarco` to directly generate a run in the MS MARCO output format.
And to evaluate:

```bash
python tools/scripts/msmarco/msmarco_doc_eval.py \
  --judgments src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/qrels.msmarco-doc.dev.txt \
  --run runs/run.msmarco-doc-segmented-unicoil.msmarco-doc.dev.txt
```

The results should be as follows:

```
