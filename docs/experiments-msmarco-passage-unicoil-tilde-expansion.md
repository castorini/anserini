# Anserini: uniCOIL w/ TILDE for MS MARCO V1 Passage Ranking

This page describes how to reproduce experiments using uniCOIL with TILDE document expansion on the MS MARCO passage corpus, as described in the following paper:

> Shengyao Zhuang and Guido Zuccon. [Fast Passage Re-ranking with Contextualized Exact Term
Matching and Efficient Passage Expansion.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08513) _arXiv:2108.08513_.

The original uniCOIL model is described here:

> Jimmy Lin and Xueguang Ma. [A Few Brief Notes on DeepImpact, COIL, and a Conceptual Framework for Information Retrieval Techniques.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14807) _arXiv:2106.14807_.

In the original uniCOIL paper, doc2query-T5 is used to perform document expansion, which is slow and expensive.
As an alternative, Zhuang and Zuccon proposed to use the TILDE model to expand the documents instead, resulting in a faster and cheaper process that is just as effective.
For details of how to use TILDE to expand documents, please refer to the [TILDE repo](https://github.com/ielab/TILDE).
For additional details on the original uniCOIL design (with doc2query-T5 expansion), please refer to the [COIL repo](https://github.com/luyug/COIL/tree/main/uniCOIL).

In this guide, we start with a version of the MS MARCO passage corpus that has already been processed with uniCOIL + TILDE, i.e., gone through document expansion and term re-weighting.
Thus, no neural inference is involved.

Note that Pyserini provides [a comparable reproduction guide](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-unicoil-tilde-expansion.md), so if you don't like Java, you can get _exactly_ the same results from Python.

## Data Prep

We're going to use the repository's root directory as the working directory.
First, we need to download and extract the MS MARCO passage dataset with uniCOIL processing:

```bash
# Alternate mirrors of the same data, pick one:
wget https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jimmylin/unicoil/-/raw/master/msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8.tar -P collections/
wget https://vault.cs.uwaterloo.ca/s/6LECmLdiaBoPwrL/download -O collections/msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8.tar

tar xvf collections/msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8.tar -C collections/
```

To confirm, `msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8.tar` should have MD5 checksum of `be0a786033140ebb7a984a3e155c19ae`.

## Indexing

We can now index these docs as a `JsonVectorCollection` using Anserini:

```bash
sh target/appassembler/bin/IndexCollection -collection JsonVectorCollection \
 -input collections/msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8/ \
 -index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-passage.unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8 \
 -generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator -impact -pretokenized \
 -threads 12
```

The important indexing options to note here are `-impact -pretokenized`: the first tells Anserini not to encode BM25 doclengths into Lucene's norms (which is the default) and the second option says not to apply any additional tokenization on the uniCOIL tokens.

Upon completion, we should have an index with 8,841,823 documents.
The indexing speed may vary; on a modern desktop with an SSD (using 12 threads, per above), indexing takes around 20 minutes.

## Retrieval

To ensure that the tokenization in the index aligns exactly with the queries, we use pre-tokenized queries.
The queries are already stored in the repo, so we can run retrieval directly:

```bash
target/appassembler/bin/SearchCollection -index indexes/lucene-index.msmarco-passage.unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8 \
 -topicreader TsvInt -topics src/main/resources/topics-and-qrels/topics.msmarco-passage.dev-subset.unicoil-tilde-expansion.tsv.gz \
 -output runs/run.msmarco-passage.unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8.tsv -format msmarco \
 -impact -pretokenized
```

Query evaluation is much slower than with bag-of-words BM25; a complete run takes around 30 minutes (on a single thread).
Note that, mirroring the indexing options, we also specify `-impact -pretokenized` here.

With `-format msmarco`, runs are already in the MS MARCO output format, so we can evaluate directly:

```bash
python tools/scripts/msmarco/msmarco_passage_eval.py \
   tools/topics-and-qrels/qrels.msmarco-passage.dev-subset.txt runs/run.msmarco-passage.unicoil-tilde-expansion-b8.tsv
```

The results should be as follows:

```
#####################
MRR @10: 0.34957184927457136
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

This corresponds to the effectiveness reported in the paper.
