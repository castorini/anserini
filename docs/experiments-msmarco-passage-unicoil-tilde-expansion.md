# Anserini: uniCOIL w/ TILDE for MS MARCO V1 Passage Ranking

This page previously hosted a guide on how to reproduce the uniCOIL + TILDE results on the MS MARCO passage corpus, as described in the following paper:

> Shengyao Zhuang and Guido Zuccon. [Fast Passage Re-ranking with Contextualized Exact Term Matching and Efficient Passage Expansion.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08513) _arXiv:2108.08513_.

The guide has been integrated in [Anserini's regression framework](regressions-msmarco-passage-unicoil-tilde-expansion.md), and this page has been reduced to a redirect stub.
