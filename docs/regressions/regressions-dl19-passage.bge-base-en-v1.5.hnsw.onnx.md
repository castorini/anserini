# Anserini Regressions: TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track (Passage)

**Model**: [BGE-base-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5) with HNSW indexes (using ONNX for on-the-fly query encoding)

This page describes regression experiments, integrated into Anserini's regression testing framework, using the [BGE-base-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5) model on the [TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track passage ranking task](https://trec.nist.gov/data/deep2019.html), as described in the following paper:

> Shitao Xiao, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang, and Niklas Muennighoff. [C-Pack: Packaged Resources To Advance General Chinese Embedding.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07597) _arXiv:2309.07597_, 2023.

In these experiments, we are performing query inference "on-the-fly" with ONNX.

Note that the NIST relevance judgments provide far more relevant passages per topic, unlike the "sparse" judgments provided by Microsoft (these are sometimes called "dense" judgments to emphasize this contrast).
For additional instructions on working with MS MARCO passage collection, refer to [this page](experiments-msmarco-passage.md).

The exact configurations for these regressions are stored in [this YAML file](../../src/main/resources/regression/dl19-passage.bge-base-en-v1.5.hnsw.onnx.yaml).
Note that this page is automatically generated from [this template](../../src/main/resources/docgen/templates/dl19-passage.bge-base-en-v1.5.hnsw.onnx.template) as part of Anserini's regression pipeline, so do not modify this page directly; modify the template instead and then run `bin/build.sh` to rebuild the documentation.

From one of our Waterloo servers (e.g., `orca`), the following command will perform the complete regression, end to end:

```bash
python src/main/python/run_regression.py --index --verify --search --regression dl19-passage.bge-base-en-v1.5.hnsw.onnx
```

We make available a version of the MS MARCO Passage Corpus that has already been encoded with cosDPR-distil.

From any machine, the following command will download the corpus and perform the complete regression, end to end:

```bash
python src/main/python/run_regression.py --download --index --verify --search --regression dl19-passage.bge-base-en-v1.5.hnsw.onnx
```

The `run_regression.py` script automates the following steps, but if you want to perform each step manually, simply copy/paste from the commands below and you'll obtain the same regression results.

## Corpus Download

Download the corpus and unpack into `collections/`:

```bash
wget https://rgw.cs.uwaterloo.ca/pyserini/data/msmarco-passage-bge-base-en-v1.5.tar -P collections/
tar xvf collections/msmarco-passage-bge-base-en-v1.5.tar -C collections/
```

To confirm, `msmarco-passage-bge-base-en-v1.5.tar` is 59 GB and has MD5 checksum `353d2c9e72e858897ad479cca4ea0db1`.
With the corpus downloaded, the following command will perform the remaining steps below:

```bash
python src/main/python/run_regression.py --index --verify --search --regression dl19-passage.bge-base-en-v1.5.hnsw.onnx \
  --corpus-path collections/msmarco-passage-bge-base-en-v1.5
```

## Indexing

Sample indexing command, building HNSW indexes:

```bash
bin/run.sh io.anserini.index.IndexHnswDenseVectors \
  -threads 16 \
  -collection JsonDenseVectorCollection \
  -input /path/to/msmarco-passage-bge-base-en-v1.5 \
  -generator DenseVectorDocumentGenerator \
  -index indexes/lucene-hnsw.msmarco-v1-passage.bge-base-en-v1.5/ \
  -M 16 -efC 100 \
  >& logs/log.msmarco-passage-bge-base-en-v1.5 &
```

The path `/path/to/msmarco-passage-bge-base-en-v1.5/` should point to the corpus downloaded above.
Upon completion, we should have an index with 8,841,823 documents.

Note that here we are explicitly using Lucene's `NoMergePolicy` merge policy, which suppresses any merging of index segments.
This is because merging index segments is a costly operation and not worthwhile given our query set.

## Retrieval

Topics and qrels are stored [here](https://github.com/castorini/anserini-tools/tree/master/topics-and-qrels), which is linked to the Anserini repo as a submodule.
The regression experiments here evaluate on the 43 topics for which NIST has provided judgments as part of the TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track.
The original data can be found [here](https://trec.nist.gov/data/deep2019.html).

After indexing has completed, you should be able to perform retrieval as follows:

```bash
bin/run.sh io.anserini.search.SearchHnswDenseVectors \
  -index indexes/lucene-hnsw.msmarco-v1-passage.bge-base-en-v1.5/ \
  -topics tools/topics-and-qrels/topics.dl19-passage.txt \
  -topicReader TsvInt \
  -output runs/run.msmarco-passage-bge-base-en-v1.5.bge-hnsw-onnx.topics.dl19-passage.txt \
  -generator VectorQueryGenerator -topicField title -threads 16 -hits 1000 -efSearch 1000 -encoder BgeBaseEn15 &
```

Evaluation can be performed using `trec_eval`:

```bash
bin/trec_eval -m map -c -l 2 tools/topics-and-qrels/qrels.dl19-passage.txt runs/run.msmarco-passage-bge-base-en-v1.5.bge-hnsw-onnx.topics.dl19-passage.txt
bin/trec_eval -m ndcg_cut.10 -c tools/topics-and-qrels/qrels.dl19-passage.txt runs/run.msmarco-passage-bge-base-en-v1.5.bge-hnsw-onnx.topics.dl19-passage.txt
bin/trec_eval -m recall.100 -c -l 2 tools/topics-and-qrels/qrels.dl19-passage.txt runs/run.msmarco-passage-bge-base-en-v1.5.bge-hnsw-onnx.topics.dl19-passage.txt
bin/trec_eval -m recall.1000 -c -l 2 tools/topics-and-qrels/qrels.dl19-passage.txt runs/run.msmarco-passage-bge-base-en-v1.5.bge-hnsw-onnx.topics.dl19-passage.txt
```

## Effectiveness

With the above commands, you should be able to reproduce the following results:

The above figures are from running brute-force search with cached queries on non-quantized **flat** indexes.
With ONNX query encoding on non-quantized HNSW indexes, observed results are likely to differ; scores may be lower by up to 0.01, sometimes more.
Note that HNSW indexing is non-deterministic (i.e., results may differ slightly between trials).

‚ùó Retrieval metrics here are computed to depth 1000 hits per query (as opposed to 100 hits per query for document ranking).
For computing nDCG, remember that we keep qrels of _all_ relevance grades, whereas for other metrics (e.g., AP), relevance grade 1 is considered not relevant (i.e., use the `-l 2` option in `trec_eval`).
The experimental results reported here are directly comparable to the results reported in the [track overview paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07820).
