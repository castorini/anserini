# Indexing the ACL Anthology with Anserini

Anserini provides code for indexing the ACL anthology with Solr in order to host an ACL anthology [Blacklight](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight) instance.

## Deploying Solr

Set up Solr locally by following the instructions for setting up a single-node SolrCloud instance in [solrini.md](solrini.md).

## Generating ACL Anthology Data

**IMPORTANT:** The ACL Anthology requires Python 3.7+; no, it won't work with Python 3.6.

First, clone the ACL anthology repository containing the raw XML data:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:acl-org/acl-anthology.git
```
 
Next, navigate to the `acl-anthology` folder and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r bin/requirements.txt
```

You may have to create the export directory by hand (this is generated by the `Makefile` automatically, so if you don't run `make` you'll need this extra step):

```bash
mkdir -p build/data
```

Generate cleaned YAML data:

1. Add the following lines to `bin/create_hugo_yaml.py` before function `export_anthology`
```python
# Prevent yaml from creating aliases which can't be parsed by anserini
Dumper.ignore_aliases = lambda self, data: True
```

2. Execute the following script:
```bash
python bin/create_hugo_yaml.py
```

Generated ACL files can now be found in `acl-anthology/build/data/`

## Indexing Data

Once we have a local instance of SolrCloud up and running, we can index using Solr through Solrini.

First, let's create the index collection in Solr using the default config.

```
solrini/bin/solr create -n anserini -c acl
```

Modify the `acl` Solr schema to allow multiValued fields for facets and set explicit field types:

```
sh src/main/resources/solr/setup/acl-anthology.sh
```

Run the Solr indexing command for `acl`:

```
sh target/appassembler/bin/IndexCollection \
  -collection AclAnthology -generator AclAnthologyGenerator \
  -threads 8 -input /path/to/acl-anthology/build/data/ \
  -solr -solr.index acl -solr.zkUrl localhost:9983 \
  -storePositions -storeDocvectors -storeContents -storeRaw
```
