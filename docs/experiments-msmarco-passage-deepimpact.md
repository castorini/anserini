# Anserini: DeepImpact for MS MARCO V1 Passage Ranking

This page previously hosted a guide on how to reproduce the DeepImpact experiments in the following paper:

> Antonio Mallia, Omar Khattab, Nicola Tonellotto, and Torsten Suel. [Learning Passage Impacts for Inverted Indexes.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404835.3463030) _SIGIR 2021_.

The guide has been integrated in [Anserini's regression framework](regressions-msmarco-passage-deepimpact.md), and this page has been reduced to a redirect stub.
