# Anserini: BM25 Baselines for MS MARCO Passage Ranking

This page contains instructions for running BM25 baselines on the [MS MARCO *passage* ranking task](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/).
Note that there is a separate [MS MARCO *document* ranking task](experiments-msmarco-doc.md).
We also have a [separate page](experiments-doc2query.md) describing document expansion experiments (Doc2query) for this task.

## Data Prep

We're going to use the repository's root directory as the working directory.
First, we need to download and extract the MS MARCO passage dataset:

```bash
mkdir collections/msmarco-passage

wget https://msmarco.blob.core.windows.net/msmarcoranking/collectionandqueries.tar.gz -P collections/msmarco-passage

# Alternative mirror:
# wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/9f54jg2f71ray3b/collectionandqueries.tar.gz -P collections/msmarco-passage

tar xvfz collections/msmarco-passage/collectionandqueries.tar.gz -C collections/msmarco-passage
```

To confirm, `collectionandqueries.tar.gz` should have MD5 checksum of `31644046b18952c1386cd4564ba2ae69`.

Next, we need to convert the MS MARCO tsv collection into Anserini's jsonl files (which have one json object per line):

```bash
python tools/scripts/msmarco/convert_collection_to_jsonl.py \
 --collection-path collections/msmarco-passage/collection.tsv \
 --output-folder collections/msmarco-passage/collection_jsonl
```

The above script should generate 9 jsonl files in `collections/msmarco-passage/collection_jsonl`, each with 1M lines (except for the last one, which should have 841,823 lines).

We can now index these docs as a `JsonCollection` using Anserini:

```bash
sh target/appassembler/bin/IndexCollection -threads 9 -collection JsonCollection \
 -generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator -input collections/msmarco-passage/collection_jsonl \
 -index indexes/msmarco-passage/lucene-index-msmarco -storePositions -storeDocvectors -storeRaw 
```

Upon completion, we should have an index with 8,841,823 documents.
The indexing speed may vary; on a modern desktop with an SSD, indexing takes a couple of minutes.

## Performing Retrieval on the Dev Queries

Since queries of the set are too many (+100k), it would take a long time to retrieve all of them. To speed this up, we use only the queries that are in the qrels file: 

```bash
python tools/scripts/msmarco/filter_queries.py \
 --qrels collections/msmarco-passage/qrels.dev.small.tsv \
 --queries collections/msmarco-passage/queries.dev.tsv \
 --output collections/msmarco-passage/queries.dev.small.tsv
```

The output queries file should contain 6980 lines.
We can now perform a retrieval run using this smaller set of queries:

```bash
sh target/appassembler/bin/SearchMsmarco -hits 1000 -threads 1 \
 -index indexes/msmarco-passage/lucene-index-msmarco \
 -queries collections/msmarco-passage/queries.dev.small.tsv \
 -output runs/run.msmarco-passage.dev.small.tsv
```

Note that by default, the above script uses BM25 with tuned parameters `k1=0.82`, `b=0.68`.
The option `-hits` specifies the number of documents per query to be retrieved.
Thus, the output file should have approximately 6980 Ã— 1000 = 6.9M lines.

Retrieval speed will vary by machine:
On a modern desktop with an SSD, we can get ~0.07 s/query, so the run should finish in under ten minutes.
We can perform multi-threaded retrieval by changing the `-threads` argument.

Finally, we can evaluate the retrieved documents using this the official MS MARCO evaluation script: 

```bash
python tools/scripts/msmarco/msmarco_passage_eval.py \
 collections/msmarco-passage/qrels.dev.small.tsv runs/run.msmarco-passage.dev.small.tsv
```

And the output should be like this:

```
#####################
MRR @10: 0.18741227770955546
QueriesRanked: 6980
#####################
```

You can find this entry on the [MS MARCO Passage Ranking Leaderboard](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/) as entry "BM25 (Lucene8, tuned)", so you've just replicated (part of) a leaderboard submission!

We can also use the official TREC evaluation tool, `trec_eval`, to compute other metrics than MRR@10. 
For that we first need to convert runs and qrels files to the TREC format:

```bash
python tools/scripts/msmarco/convert_msmarco_to_trec_run.py \
 --input runs/run.msmarco-passage.dev.small.tsv \
 --output runs/run.msmarco-passage.dev.small.trec

python tools/scripts/msmarco/convert_msmarco_to_trec_qrels.py \
 --input collections/msmarco-passage/qrels.dev.small.tsv \
 --output collections/msmarco-passage/qrels.dev.small.trec
```

And run the `trec_eval` tool:

```bash
tools/eval/trec_eval.9.0.4/trec_eval -c -mrecall.1000 -mmap \
 collections/msmarco-passage/qrels.dev.small.trec runs/run.msmarco-passage.dev.small.trec
```

The output should be:

```
map                   	all	0.1957
recall_1000           	all	0.8573
```

Average precision and recall@1000 are the two metrics we care about the most.

## BM25 Tuning

Note that this figure differs slightly from the value reported in [Document Expansion by Query Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08375), which uses the Anserini (system-wide) default of `k1=0.9`, `b=0.4`.

Tuning was accomplished with `tools/scripts/msmarco/tune_bm25.py`, using the queries found [here](https://github.com/castorini/Anserini-data/tree/master/MSMARCO); the basic approach is grid search of parameter values in tenth increments.
There are five different sets of 10k samples (using the `shuf` command).
We tuned on each individual set and then averaged parameter values across all five sets (this has the effect of regularization).
In separate trials, we optimized for:

+ recall@1000, since Anserini output serves as input to downstream rerankers (e.g., based on BERT), and we want to maximize the number of relevant documents the rerankers have to work with;
+ MRR@10, for the case where Anserini output is directly presented to users (i.e., no downstream reranking).

It turns out that optimizing for MRR@10 and MAP yields the same settings.

Here's the comparison between the Anserini default and optimized parameters:

Setting                     | MRR@10 | MAP    | Recall@1000 |
:---------------------------|-------:|-------:|------------:|
Default (`k1=0.9`, `b=0.4`) | 0.1840 | 0.1926 | 0.8526
Optimized for recall@1000 (`k1=0.82`, `b=0.68`) | 0.1874 | 0.1957 | 0.8573
Optimized for MRR@10/MAP (`k1=0.60`, `b=0.62`)  | 0.1892 | 0.1972 | 0.8555

To replicate these results, the `SearchMsmarco` class above takes `k1` and `b` parameters as command-line arguments, e.g., `-k1 0.60 -b 0.62` (note that the default setting is `k1=0.82` and `b=0.68`).
