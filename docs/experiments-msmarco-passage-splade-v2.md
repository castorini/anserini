# Anserini: SPLADEv2 for MS MARCO V1 Passage Ranking

This page previously hosted a guide on how to reproduce the SPLADEv2 results with the DistilSPLADE-max model from the following paper:

> Thibault Formal, Carlos Lassance, Benjamin Piwowarski, St√©phane Clinchant. [SPLADE v2: Sparse Lexical and Expansion Model for Information Retrieval.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10086) _arXiv:2109.10086_.

The guide has been integrated in [Anserini's regression framework](regressions-msmarco-passage-distill-splade-max.md), and this page has been reduced to a redirect stub.
